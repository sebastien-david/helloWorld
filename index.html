        Colchis is the home of king Aeetes, queen Idyia and princess Medea, the
        Golden Fleece and fire-breathing bulls Khalkotauroi. Colchis is a
        fabulously wealthy land situated on the mysterious periphery of the
        heroic world, in the sacred grove of the war god Ares. Colchis is also
        the land where the mythological Prometheus was punished by being chained
        to a mountain while an eagle ate at his liver for revealing to humanity
        the secret of fire. In honor of Zeus, Colchis organizes a series of
        athletic competitions among representatives of city-states, that are
        recognized throughout the ancient greece.
